\chapter*{Foreword}

Word on notation used throughout this work. Creature stats are abbreaviated (\strength, \dexterity, \constitution, \intelligence, \wisdom{} and \charisma), while saving throws get $\diamondsuit$ next to them (\strengthsave, \dexteritysave, \constitutionsave, \intelligencesave, \wisdomsave{} and \charismasave).

Skills are always writen in capitals with main stat in paranthesis. For example deception is displayed as \deception, stealth as \stealth{} and so on.
