\chapter{Poisoner's kit}

\section{Mechanics}

Poisoner's kit is used to gather poisonous ingredients from environment and creation of poisons. One does not have to be proficient in it to use it but then proficiency bonus doesn't apply to checks.

Each poison requires flask, water and amount of poisonous substances that depends on the level of poison.

On failed crafting attempt ingredients other than flask are destroyed.

\subsection{Poison Types}

Poisons come in the four types.

\textbf{Contact}

Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

\textbf{Ingested}

A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

\textbf{Inhaled}

These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

\textbf{Injury}

Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

\section{Gathering ingredients}

\subsection{Foraging}

Player with poisoner's kit can decide to try and forage poisonous substances from environment.
DM declares DC for environment (it is easier to find poisonous substances in a swamp than in desert).
Knowing DC, player can decide to spend one hour searching for poisonous ingredients in and around current location.

$$\mathrm{Gathering\,modifier} = \mathrm{\survival} + \mathrm{Proficiency} $$

The foraging can be performed once a day in any given area.
If another player decides to offer help foraging, survival check is made with advantage but amount of ingredients gained is the same.
If player successfully passes gathering check they roll on an ingredients table for given environment and add item to their inventory.

\subsection{Scavenging from bodies}

When a poisonous or venomous creature is slain player with poison kit can extract some ingredients from it. DM decides amount of extracted ingredients based on players nature check (With proficiency if proficient in poisoner's kit). For extremely magical creatures make arcana check again. If demon or celestial, make religion check instead.
Player needs to provide container to store ingredients harvested (flask for troll blood for example).
