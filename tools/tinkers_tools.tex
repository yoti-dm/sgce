\subsection{Earrings of whispers}

An Earring of Whispers is an enchanted item that delivers and receives message spells to and from the other connected earrings within range. To send a message, the wearer must activate the earring by touching it, although it will passively receive messages.

Upon creation earring either becomes a part of new network or is added to existing one if creator has access to another earring already in network. After that earrings can't switch between networks. Arcana check is needed for creation.
