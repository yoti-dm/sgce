\section{Automatons}

\subsection{Mechanical brains}

Mechanical brains give thinking capabilities to alchemical beings. They don't however give free will or internal motivations so alchemical beings
depend fully on their programming.

\subsubsection{Tiny mechanical brain}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 14 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 6 hours
\item [Materials] 2 cogs, 1 spring, 2 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Small mechanical brain}

\begin{description}

\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] 3 cogs, 2 springs, 2 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Medium mechanical brain}

\subsubsection{Huge mechanical brain}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 22 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 32 hours
\item [Materials] 12 cogs, 6 springs, 8 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsection{Mechanical hearts}

Mechanical hearts give life to many alchemical beings. In the process of creation they however require alchemist to donate some of their own life energy.
To donate one drop of blood you take 1d4 necrotic damage that can't be prevented in any way. This damage can not be healed as long as heart is running. If
alchemist dies all hearts that were using their life energy stop.

\subsubsection{Tiny mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 14 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 6 hours
\item [Materials] 2 cogs, 1 spring, drop of mercury, drop of blood
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Small mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 16 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Medium mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 18 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 10 hours
\item [Materials] 4 cogs, 3 springs, 2 drops of mercury, 2 drops of blood
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Large mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 20 \arcana

\item [Materials] 12 cogs, 6 springs, 4 drops of mercury, 4 drops of blood
\end{description}

\subsection{Alcemical beings}

You can create alcemical beings to serve your every order. You can have one such being in your service on character levels 1 - 5, 2 on levels 6 - 10, 
3 on levels 11-15 and 4 on higher levels. You must create at least one being of certain level before you can create a being of higher level. You can stop
hearts of beings you don't want in your service anymore at will, becoming able to heal life energy donated to give them life. You can't have 2 beings of same
level in your service at once. To restart stoped being, donate appropriate ammount of blood drops to restart heart.

\subsubsection{Alarmunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 12 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] Tiny mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, 2 cogs, 2 springs
\item [Level] 1
\end{description}

Tiny alchemical being that can stand still or move in 6 ft radius circle. It can be programmed using 10 minutes and DC 12 \intelligence{} (without added proficiency for alchemist kit) for any amount of time. After programmed time has passed alarmunculus starts emiting very loud metalic sound. This sound lasts for 1 hour, until Alarmunculus is destroyed (HP 4, AC 12) or until it is stoped by someone passing 12 \intelligence.

\subsubsection{Guardmunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 12 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] Tiny mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, tiny glass sphere, 2 cogs, 1 spring
\item [Level] 1
\end{description}

Tiny alchemical being that is not able to move on its own. It can be programmed using 10 minutes and DC 12 intelligence check (without added proficiency for alchemist kit) to remember up to 10 creatures. If any creature other than those creatures enters alarmunculus view (perception 18, 60 ft range, 60 ft perfect dark vision) it sounds very loud alarm. It only sees things in cone in front of it.

\subsubsection{Torchmunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 12 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] Tiny mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, tiny glass sphere, 2 cogs, 1 spring
\item [Level] 1
\end{description}

Tiny alchemical being that can be programmed to follow a creature that has programmed it. While doing so its tiny glass sphere glows like a torch. After one hour Torchmunkulus runs out of energy, stops and goes dark. It takes it 8 hours to recharcge itself.

\subsubsection{Drinkmunkulus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 12 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] Tiny mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, tiny glass sphere, 2 cogs, 1 spring
\item [Level] 1
\end{description}

Tiny alchemical being that is able to warm, chill or mix a drink. It is not capable of moving on its own.

\subsubsection{Injectormunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 13 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 16 hours
\item [Materials] Tiny mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, vial, 2 cogs, 2 springs
\item [Level] 2
\end{description}

Tiny alchemical being that can store a potion. It can be programmed unsing 10 minutes and DC 12 \intelligence (without added proficiency for alchemist kit) to attach to person and administer potion given condition.

Example would be "feed potion of health when unconcious".

You must provide potion when programming Inejctormunculus and it only acts at the end of turn of a creature it is programmed for. It acts on its own at the end of owner's turn and does not require actions from creature it is attached to.

\subsubsection{Speakmunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 13 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 16 hours
\item [Materials] Small mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, vial, 1 cog, 1 spring
\item [Level] 2
\end{description}

Tiny mechanical being that can translate any spoken language it was ever programmed for. Takes one hour and a DC 12 \intelligence by someone who speaks language to program it into Speakmunculus. It can't move on its own.

\subsubsection{Scribmunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 14 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 16 hours
\item [Materials] small mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, vial, 2 cogs, feather
\item [Level] 3
\end{description}

Tiny mechanical being capable of writing in any language its creator knows. Can write dictated word or copy manuscrips (1 page per minute). Can copy spells into spell book (cost and time required are the same as if wizard did it and wizard can't use spell book in mean time). Can copy entire spellbook for wizard to keep backup. Cost and time requirements remain the same.

\section{Potions}

\subsubsection{Alchemist fire}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 16 \arcana
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] flask, (earth, fire and water must be available)
\end{description}

This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
