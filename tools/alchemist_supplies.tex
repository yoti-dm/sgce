\section{Automatons}

\subsection{Mechanical brains}

Mechanical brains give thinking capabilities to alchemical beings. They don't however give free will or internal motivations so alchemical beings
depend fully on their programming.

\subsubsection{Tiny mechanical brain}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 14 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 6 hours
\item [Materials] 2 cogs, 1 spring, 2 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Small mechanical brain}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 16 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] 3 cogs, 2 springs, 2 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Medium mechanical brain}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 18 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 10 hours
\item [Materials] 4 cogs, 3 springs, 4 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Large mechanical brain}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 20 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 16 hours
\item [Materials] 6 cogs, 4 springs, 6 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Huge mechanical brain}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 22 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 32 hours
\item [Materials] 12 cogs, 6 springs, 8 drops of mercury
\end{description}

\subsection{Mechanical hearts}

Mechanical hearts give life to many alchemical beings. In the process of creation they however require alchemist to donate some of their own life energy.
To donate one drop of blood you take 1d4 necrotic damage that can't be prevented in any way. This damage can not be healed as long as heart is running. If
alchemist dies all hearts that were using their life energy stop.

\subsubsection{Tiny mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 14 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 6 hours
\item [Materials] 2 cogs, 1 spring, drop of mercury, drop of blood
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Small mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 16 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] 3 cogs, 2 springs, drop of mercury, drop of blood
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Medium mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 18 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 10 hours
\item [Materials] 4 cogs, 3 springs, 2 drops of mercury, 2 drops of blood
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Large mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 20 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 16 hours
\item [Materials] 6 cogs, 4 springs, 3 drops of mercury, 3 drops of blood
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Huge mechanical heart}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 22 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 32 hours
\item [Materials] 12 cogs, 6 springs, 4 drops of mercury, 4 drops of blood
\end{description}

\subsection{Alcemical beings}

You can create alcemical beings to serve your every order. You can have one such being in your service on character levels 1 - 5, 2 on levels 6 - 10, 
3 on levels 11-15 and 4 on higher levels. You must create at least one being of certain level before you can create a being of higher level. You can stop
hearts of beings you don't want in your service anymore at will, becoming able to heal life energy donated to give them life. You can't have 2 beings of same
level in your service at once. To restart stoped being, donate appropriate ammount of blood drops to restart heart.

\subsubsection{Alarmunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 12 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 8 hours
\item [Materials] Tiny mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, tiny glass sphere, 2 cogs, 1 spring
\item [Level] 1
\end{description}

Tiny alchemical being that is not able to move on its own. It can be programmed using 10 minutes and DC 12 intelligence check (without added proficiency for alchemist kit) to remember up to 10 creatures. If any creature other than those creatures enters alarmunculus view (perception 18, 60 ft range, 60 ft perfect dark vision) it sounds very loud alarm. It only sees things in cone in front of it.

\subsubsection{Injectormunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 13 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 16 hours
\item [Materials] Tiny mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, vial, 2 cogs, 2 springs
\item [Level] 2
\end{description}

Tiny alchemical being that can store a potion. It can be programmed unsing 10 minutes and DC intelligence check (without added proficiency for alchemist kit) to attach to person and administer potion to them given condition.

Example would be "feed potion of health when unconcious".

You must provide potion when programming Inejctormunculus and it only acts at the end of turn of a creature it is programmed for. It acts on its own and does not require actions from creature it is attached to.

\subsubsection{Scribmunculus}

\begin{description}
\item [DC] 14 arcana check
\item [Crafting time] 16 hours
\item [Materials] small mechanical brains, tiny mechanical heart, vial, 2 cogs, feather
\item [Level] 3
\end{description}

Tiny mechanical being capable of writing in any language its creator knows. Can write dictated word or copy manuscrips (1 page per minute). Can copy spells into spell book (cost and time required are the same as if wizard did it and wizard can't use spell book in mean time). Can copy entire spellbook for wizard to keep backup. Cost and time requirements remain the same.
